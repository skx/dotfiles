;;; Commentary:
;; The outline-indent.el Emacs package provides a minor mode that enables code
;; folding based on indentation levels.
;;
;; The outline-indent.el package is a fast and reliable alternative to the
;; origami.el and yafolding.el packages. (origami.el and yafolding.el are no
;; longer maintained, slow, and known to have bugs that impact their reliability
;; and performance.)
;;
;; In addition to code folding, outline-indent allows:
;; - Moving indented subtrees up and down,
;; - indent/unindent sections to adjust indentation levels,
;; - customizing the ellipsis,
;; - inserting a new line with the same indentation level as the current line,
;; - and other features.
;;
;; The outline-indent.el package uses the built-in outline-minor-mode, which is
;; maintained by the Emacs developers and is less likely to be abandoned like
;; origami.el or yafolding.el. Since outline-indent.el is based on
;; outline-minor-mode, it's also much much faster than origami.el and
;; yafolding.el.
;;
;; Installation from MELPA:
;; ------------------------
;; (use-package outline-indent
;;   :ensure t
;;   :custom
;;   (outline-indent-ellipsis " â–¼ "))
;;
;; Activation:
;; -----------
;; Once installed, the minor mode can be activated using:
;;   (outline-indent-minor-mode)
;;
;; Activation using a hook:
;; ------------------------
;; The minor mode can also be automatically activated for a certain mode. For
;; example for Python and YAML:
;;   ;; Python
;;   (add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
;;   (add-hook 'python-ts-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
;;
;;   ;; YAML
;;   (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
;;   (add-hook 'yaml-ts-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
;;
;; Adjusting the shift width and default offset
;; --------------------------------------------
;; You can adjust the outline-indent-shift-width and
;; outline-indent-default-offset according to your preferences. While the
;; default value of 1 is adequate for most modes, setting the appropriate value
;; ensures that the promote and demote functions correctly adjust the
;; indentation of blocks.
;;
;; For example:
;;   ;; Python
;;   (dolist (hook '(python-mode python-ts-mode-hook))
;;     (add-hook hook #'(lambda()
;;                        (setq-local outline-indent-default-offset 4)
;;                        (setq-local outline-indent-shift-width 4))))
;;
;;   ;; YAML
;;   (dolist (hook '(yaml-mode yaml-ts-mode-hook))
;;     (add-hook hook #'(lambda()
;;                        (setq-local outline-indent-default-offset 2)
;;                        (setq-local outline-indent-shift-width 2)))

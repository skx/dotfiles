;; org-diary.el
;;
;; This is a derived mode of org-mode, which contains a couple of helpers
;; for maintaining a simple diary.
;;
;; A diary is nothing more than an org-mode file which contains a list
;; of date-based headers, for example:
;;
;;   * 01/01/2022
;;   ** Meetings
;;   ** TODO
;;   * 02/01/2022
;;   ** Meetings
;;   ** TODO
;;   * 03/01/2022
;;   ** Meetings
;;   ** TODO
;;   * DD/MM/YYYY
;;   ** Meetings
;;   ** TODO
;;   * END
;;
;; The idea is that you might maintain a standard entry template, and you
;; can add a new entry for each new-day.
;;

;; For string-trim
(eval-when-compile (require 'subr-x))

;; List of things we expand within a new entry, as we create it.
;;
;; The pairs are "regexp" + "replacement" which is invoked via "apply".

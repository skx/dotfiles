# In the past the default branch was often "master", which was the default for
# both git and github.
#
# Nowadays most people seem to prefer to use "main".
#
# If you're working with multiple repositories this now means that the default
# branch is going to vary, and this tool will show you what is in-use, by examining
# the remote.
#
# Sample usage:
#
#   $ cd dotfiles/ ; git-default-branch
#   master
#
#   $ cd segmentor/ ; git-default-branch
#   develop
#
#   $ cd infra-tools/ ; git-default-branch
#   main
#


#
# Get the remote - there might be more than one, but we'll
# assume that in this case they'll all have the same
# default branch.
#
remote=$(git remote | egrep -o '(upstream|origin)' | tail -1)

#
# Using the remote show the value of "HEAD branch:"
#
git remote show "$remote" | awk '/HEAD branch/ {print $NF}'
